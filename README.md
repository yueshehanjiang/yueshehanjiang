## Project Experience  
### CMU 10-414/714: Deep Learning Systems  
- Implemented a lightweight deep learning framework, `needle`, supporting automatic differentiation, neural network modules, and optimizers.  
- Developed core modules, including automatic differentiation, linear layers, ReLU, Dropout, BatchNorm, and LayerNorm, as well as SGD and Adam optimizers.  
- Designed an MLP-based ResNet model, trained and evaluated its performance on the MNIST dataset, and optimized the training process using Kaiming and Xavier initialization methods.  

### CMU 15-455/645 Fall 2023 Database Systems  
- Built `bustub`, a relational database management system implemented in C++, supporting basic SQL, memory management, indexing, optimizers, executors, and snapshot isolation-level concurrency control.  
- ‚Äã**Buffer Pool**: Managed disk data pages in memory using the LRU-K page replacement algorithm, reducing disk access and enabling efficient data read/write through background threads and message queues.  
- ‚Äã**Indexing**: Implemented a scalable hash table-based hash index, supporting concurrent lookups and insertions for efficient and scalable indexing.  
- ‚Äã**Query Engine**: Designed a volcano-model query engine with common operators like SeqScan, IndexScan, JOIN, and GROUP BY, and improved query performance through rule-based optimizers (e.g., converting nested loop joins to hash joins and implementing Top-N optimizations).  
- ‚Äã**Concurrency Control**: Implemented an MVCC-based concurrency controller supporting snapshot isolation, using timestamps for transaction and tuple concurrency control.
